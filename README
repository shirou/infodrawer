input
--------

Google Reader Starred
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Get information from "Stared" entry from your Google Reader.

You should make "public" your starred.

Example
|  googlereader:
|    url: http://www.google.com/reader/public/atom/user/XXXXX/state/com.google/starred

url
  RSS feed url of your Stared Google Reader. Can get from "settings" in Google Reader


Twitter 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


|  twitter:
|    url: http://twitter.com/statuses/user_timeline/XXXXX.rss
|    keyword: "Memo"

url
  RSS feed URL of your timeline

"keyword" means if this keyword is in your tweet, output it. if "keyword" is not in conf.yaml, all of your tweet will be output-ed.

Twitter Favorites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Get information from your "Favorites" tweet.

|  twitterfav:
|    url: http://twitter.com/favorites/XXXXX.rss

url
  RSS feed URL of your favorites.

output
--------

Instapaper
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Register to instapaper.

Example
|  instapaper:
|    username: XXXX@example.com
|    password: xxXpasswordXxx

mail
~~~~~~~

Send mail to specified mail address.

Example
|  mail:
|    mail_addr: XXXX@example.com
|    from_addr: infodrawer@example.com # if use gmail, replaced to the addr
|    insta: yes
|    subject: "[Drawer]"
|    smtp: localhost 
|    use_gmail: no # if yes, smtp will be ignored
|    gmail_addr: XXXX@gmail.com
|    gmail_pass: xxXgmailpassXxx

Mail address can be set multiple addresses like this.

|    mail_addr: XXXX@example.com, XXXX-2@example.com

If you want to use gmail instead of your SMTP server, change use_gmail
to "yes" and write down address and password. If use_gmail is "yes", smtp will be ignored and from_addr is replaced to gmail_addr by gmail.com.

insta
  if yes, use instpaper.com to abbreviate.
subject
  Set prefix of mail subject.

Evernote
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Send to evernote via mail.

Example
|  evernote:
|    mail_addr: XXXX@m.evernote.com
|    from_addr: infodrawer@example.com # if use gmail, replaced to the addr
|    note: "Memo"
|    tag: "infodrawer"
|    smtp: localhost 
|    use_gmail: yes # if yes, smtp will be ignored
|    gmail_addr: XXXX@gmail.com
|    gmail_pass: xxXgmailpassXxx

Almost same as mail output.
